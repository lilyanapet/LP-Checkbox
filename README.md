# LP-Checkbox
Custom Umbraco Checkbox with sort order

This field renders a list of checkbox items from the site which are related to the current page the field is on.

When creating a field of this type, it is asking you for the api url to retrieve the data from :
api/{controller}/{action}

The id of the current page is retrieved from the route.
